# MIT Computer Science and Engineering Self-Study

Welcome to Julian Drangosch's GitHub repository dedicated to documenting the journey through the MIT Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) curriculum via MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW). This repository serves as a comprehensive record of coursework, projects, notes, and resources used throughout the self-study program.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories corresponding to each course in the MIT CSE curriculum. Each course directory contains:

**Syllabus.md:** An outline of the course, including objectives, topics covered, and any relevant links to the MIT OCW page.  
**Lecture Notes:** Notes taken during lectures, organized by date or topic.  
**Assignments:** All assignments and projects completed for the course, including problem sets, code, and reports.  
**Exams:** Practice exams and solutions, where applicable.  
**Resources:** Additional materials such as textbooks, research papers, and external links that were helpful for the course.  

## Course List

The repository follows the structure of the MIT CSE curriculum. Here is an overview of the courses:
